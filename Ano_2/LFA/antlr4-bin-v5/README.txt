In this zip file you can find a group of useful scripts to aid with ANTLR4 programming.

INSTALL.txt:
- Instructions for antlr4 installation.

antlr4:
- ANTLR4 grammar compiler.

antlr4-build:
- Script that applies antlr4 to all existing *.g4 files in current directory or in
  subdirectories and, if successful, compiles the generated java code (with javac command).
- Assumes that grammars in subdirectories belong to the corresponding java's package.

antlr4-clean:
- Removes all files that were automatically generated by antlr4 compiler for all grammar files
  in current directory or in subdirectories.
- All existing *.class files are also removed.

antlr4-main:
- Creates a java Main class for a grammar.  This command has several options that allows
  the creation of a line interpreter and/or the inclusion of listeners and/or visitors
  (execute antlr4-main without arguments to see all the available options).
- This script creates proper code for old antlr4 versions (<= 4.6) and for new versions (>= 4.7).

antlr4-run:
- Runs the compiler present in current directory or in a subdirectory (fails if none exists,
  or if there are more than one).
- Accepts program files as arguments (uses stdin if no argument is passed).

antlr4-test:
- Applies antlr4 test tool to a grammar.
- The new version tries to be smart, and accepts its execution without arguments (or simply with -tokens, -tree,
  or -gui argument). It finds the grammar and start rule by looking at *.g4 file in current directory and in
  subdirectories (fails if none exists, or if there are more than one).
- The start rule will be the first rule defined in that grammar (comments and preamble actions are ignored
  in the processing).
- In the smart version, you can use -t and -g options as a replacement of -tokens and -gui.
- Please note that the smart version of this command only works if C compiler is installed in out system
  (command cpp is used to clean up comments of ANTLR4 grammar file).

java-clean:
- Recursively removes all java bytecode files (*.class).

view-javadoc:
- Opens the javadoc documentation of a class in a browser.
- Requires that instalation of javadoc documentation in the computer.
- If you install ANTLR4 documentation (antlr4-4.7.1-javadoc.zip) in /usr/local/doc directory, no change is
  required to make this command work on ANTLR4 documentation (try with: view-javadoc Tool); Otherwise,
  you'll need to edit this scriptand change same variable (see the script's source code).
